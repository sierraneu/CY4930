## Cybersecurity Capstone

#### Course Number:     CY4930
#### Total Credit Hours:   4



### **Course Description**

Provides the culmination of the learned principles and methodologies for identifying and addressing Cybersecurity issues in organizations. Students bring their individual skills and abilities to create a solution to a real-world cybersecurity problem/challenge. Students will work in small groups to identify and scope the information security problem/challenge, create a project plan to develop a solution to include the development and identification of the data necessary to properly solve the problem/challenge, develop a final report (whose intended audience are senior business executives) and participate in the MSCY Capstone Event to present the results they have obtained. 

 

Further the students will be required to manage and develop the project using some SCRUM methodology tools. In this way, *sprints* will be planned for each project and the team will deliver the product after each sprint iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback. 

 

### **Course Objectives**

 

A student who successfully completes this course should demonstrate the following skills and knowledge:

 

\-    An understanding of Agile methodology

\-    An ability to evaluate the cybersecurity project needs and a program to meet those needs.
